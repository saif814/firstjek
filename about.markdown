Hey there!  
I'm a second-semester Computer Science student who loves to code and build things for fun (and learning, of course!).

This blog is my little corner of the internet where I experiment, share mistakes, and grow as a developer. My very first post was all about a silly mistake I made while pushing code to GitHub — I accidentally uploaded `node_modules`  (rookie move, I know!). But hey, that's how we learn, right?

I'm currently exploring web development, and creating this Jekyll blog was a part of that journey.  
Stick around if you’re into code, curious about tech, or just want to follow along as I figure things out one line of code at a time.

Thanks for stopping by!
