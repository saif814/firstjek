A personal portfolio and blog built with Jekyll. Sharing projects, posts, and the path of a developer in progress.


#  My Jekyll Site â€” Portfolio, Blog & More

Welcome to the code behind my personal site!  
Built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), powered by curiosity, bugs, and way too much caffeine.

This site is a blend of:
-  My portfolio â€“ dev work, projects, and things Iâ€™m proud of
-  A blog â€“ where I write about the stuff I break, build, and learn
-  About me â€“ because every dev site needs a tiny bit of narcissism

---

##  Features

- Jekyll-powered static site
- Fully responsive layout (even if I broke it once or twice)
- Markdown-based blogging
- Hosted on GitHub Pages â€” for free!
