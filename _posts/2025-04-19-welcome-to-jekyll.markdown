Every journey has its first step — and often, a stumble or two.

Today, I want to share something small but important from my very first experience using GitHub.

###  The Mistake

When I first uploaded my project to GitHub, I **accidentally committed my entire `node_modules` folder** — over 800 files!  
I had no idea that such folders **should not be pushed to GitHub**, and it made my repository look bloated and messy.

Honestly, it felt a little embarrassing at first — especially because this was my **very first time** using Git and GitHub.

###  What I Learned

But instead of deleting everything or panicking, I took a deep breath and **learned how to fix it**. Here's what I did:

- I learned about `.gitignore` and how to prevent unwanted files from being tracked.
- I cleaned my repository and made a fresh commit.
- I also understood that **mistakes are part of learning** — especially when you’re experimenting.

This one small issue helped me understand Git better than any tutorial could have.

###  The Best Part

Now, I'm writing this post on my **very first Jekyll site**, which is hosted on GitHub Pages — and that alone feels amazing.  
Yes, I made mistakes, but I learned, fixed them, and kept moving forward.

If you're just starting out with Git, GitHub, or Jekyll — **don’t worry about messing up.** Everyone does. What matters is learning from it.

Thanks for reading,
